How close are we to giving every child with cancer a treatment made just for them? The world of pediatric oncology is changing fast, and personalized treatments are becoming a reality. Let's explore the exciting progress being made in this field.

#### What is Personalized Pediatric Oncology?

Personalized pediatric oncology is about treating each child's cancer in a way that's tailored to their specific needs. 

Instead of using the same treatment for all kids with a certain type of cancer, doctors look closely at the genetic makeup of each child's cancer cells. This helps them choose treatments that are more likely to work and have fewer side effects.

### Recent Breakthroughs

#### Functional Precision Medicine

A groundbreaking study in 2024 showed that functional precision medicine (FPM) could significantly improve outcomes for children with hard-to-treat cancers. Here's how it worked:

- Researchers tested samples of patients' tumor tissue against over 120 FDA-approved drugs.
- They then recommended the most effective treatments to the patients' doctors.
- An amazing 83% of patients who received these guided treatments showed improvement.

This approach not only provided safer and more effective options but also made them more accessible and affordable.

#### The ZERO Childhood Cancer Program

Australia's ZERO Childhood Cancer Program has made significant strides in personalized treatment for high-risk childhood cancers:

- The study included 384 children with high-risk cancers.
- 55% of children who received personalized treatment achieved complete or partial remission, or had their disease stabilized for at least six months.
- These results were observed over an average of three years after treatment.

This world-first study showed that precision medicine led to significantly improved outcomes compared to standard or non-guided therapy.

#### The PRISM Trial

The PRecISion Medicine for Children with Cancer (PRISM) trial has also shown promising results:

- 256 out of 384 patients (67%) received personalized treatment recommendations.
- 110 patients (29%) actually received the recommended treatment.
- Those who received personalized treatment had a 36% objective response rate.
- The 2-year progression-free survival rate was 26% for those receiving personalized treatment, compared to only 12% for standard care.

#### The INFORM Registry

In Sweden, the INFORM registry has been collecting data on children with relapsed, refractory, or progressive cancer:

- 184 patients were included in the registry from 2016 to 2021.
- In 88% of the samples, at least one actionable target was identified.
- Highly prioritized targets were found in 24% of samples.
- 24 patients received matched targeted treatment based on these findings.

#### Challenges and Opportunities

While these results are exciting, there are still challenges to overcome:

1. Access to Testing: Not all hospitals have the ability to do the complex genetic testing needed for personalized treatments.
2. Limited Clinical Trials: There aren't always clinical trials available for every type of genetic change found in a child's cancer.
3. Cost: Personalized treatments can be expensive, which can make it hard for some families to access them.
4. Time: It can take several weeks to get the results of genetic tests, which can be challenging when a child needs treatment quickly.
5. Interpreting Results: Sometimes, the genetic changes found in a child's cancer are complex and hard to understand.

Despite these challenges, researchers and doctors are working hard to make personalized treatments more accessible:

- More hospitals are getting the equipment and expertise needed for genetic testing.
- New clinical trials are being developed all the time.
- Efforts are being made to reduce the cost of personalized treatments.
- Researchers are working on faster ways to analyze genetic information.
- Artificial intelligence is being used to help interpret complex genetic data.

#### The Future of Pediatric Oncology

The future of pediatric oncology looks bright. Here are some exciting developments on the horizon:

1. Liquid Biopsies: Researchers are working on ways to detect and analyze cancer cells from a simple blood test, making it easier to monitor how a child's cancer is responding to treatment.
2. Immunotherapy: This treatment helps a child's own immune system fight cancer. Personalized immunotherapies are being developed that are tailored to each child's specific cancer.
3. Gene Editing: Techniques like CRISPR are being explored as ways to correct the genetic mutations that cause cancer.
4. Artificial Intelligence: AI is being used to analyze vast amounts of data from many patients, helping to identify patterns and predict which treatments might work best for each child.
5. Combination Therapies: Researchers are finding that combining personalized treatments with traditional therapies can be very effective.

#### Final Thoughts 

We're closer than ever to making personalized treatments the standard of care for children with cancer. While there's still work to be done, the progress made in recent years is truly exciting. Every day, researchers and doctors are learning more about how to tailor treatments to each child's unique needs.

For families dealing with childhood cancer, this progress offers hope. It means that more children will have access to treatments that are not only more effective but also have fewer side effects. It means a better quality of life during treatment and a better chance of long-term survival.

With continued research, collaboration, and innovation, we can look forward to a day when every child with cancer receives a treatment plan that's as unique as they are.
